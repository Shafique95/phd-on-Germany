You're absolutely right to question that! I apologize for the confusing phrasing. Let me clarify what I mean:

## **What I Actually Mean**

I'm **NOT** suggesting you become a "Jack of All Trades." I'm suggesting the **opposite** - that you should **specialize and go deep** with Flutter.

## **My Point Was:**

**Better to be:**
- **Flutter Expert** (deep specialist) ✅
- Known as "the Flutter guy" in your network
- Someone who can solve complex Flutter problems
- A go-to person for Flutter projects

**Rather than:**
- **Beginner in 5 technologies** ❌
- Flutter + Basic Go + Basic Laravel + Basic Spring Boot + Basic Next.js
- Jack of all trades, master of none
- Competing with everyone in every technology

## **The Real Choice You're Facing**

**Option 1: Stay with Flutter (My recommendation)**
- Become a **Flutter specialist**
- Deep expertise in one valuable technology
- Higher rates, better opportunities
- Clear path to PhD research

**Option 2: Learn Multiple New Stacks**
- Spread yourself thin across technologies
- Compete with more developers
- Lower expertise in each technology
- Harder to stand out

## **Why Specialization Wins**

**In Today's Market:**
- **Specialists earn more** than generalists
- **Companies prefer experts** for critical projects
- **Remote work favors specialists** who can solve specific problems
- **PhD programs value deep knowledge** over broad knowledge

**Your Flutter expertise is valuable** - don't abandon it to chase other technologies right now.

## **What I Should Have Said Clearly**

"Focus on becoming a **Flutter specialist** rather than learning multiple technologies superficially. Deep expertise in Flutter will serve you better than basic knowledge of many frameworks."

Does this make more sense? I'm advocating for **specialization** (going deep with Flutter), not being a jack of all trades.
